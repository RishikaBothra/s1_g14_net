Example Lecture Scribe (structure only):
Lecture 0: Introduction to Logic
1. Definitions
Proposition: A declarative statement that is either true or false, but not both.
Notation: Denoted by lowercase letters $p, q, r$.
Compound Proposition: A proposition formed from existing propositions using logical operators.
2. Logical Operators
Negation ($\neg p$): The statement "it is not the case that p".
Truth Table: If $p$ is True, $\neg p$ is False.
3. Theorems and Proofs
Theorem 1 (De Morgan's Law): $\neg(p \land q) \equiv \neg p \lor \neg q$
Proof:
Construct a truth table for both sides.
Observe that for all truth value assignments of $p$ and $q$, the column for $\neg(p \land q)$ is identical to $\neg p \lor \neg q$.
Thus, the statements are logically equivalent.
4. Worked Example
Problem: Show that $p \lor \neg p$ is a tautology.
Solution:
Step 1: Assign logical values.
Step 2: If $p=T$, then $\neg p=F$, so $T \lor F = T$.
Step 3: If $p=F$, then $\neg p=T$, so $F \lor T = T$.
Conclusion: In all cases, the result is True.
Instructions:
Using the same structure as the example above, generate a lecture scribe for the provided context (lecture slides/textbook).
Requirements:

Purpose: The scribe must serve as exam reference material.


Content: Include definitions, notation, assumptions, theorem statements, proofs, derivations, and worked examples exactly as presented in the lecture materials.


Faithfulness: Do not introduce new examples, creative explanations, or intuition not discussed in the context. Everything must be traceable to the provided files.


Format: Use clear Markdown headers, bullet points for definitions, and LaTeX formatting for all mathematical notation.
