Task: Generate a lecture scribe intended as exam-oriented reference material. The scribe must be faithful to the provided context and suitable for closed-notes exam revision.

Context rules: Use only the attached context (lecture slides and relevant textbook excerpts). Do not introduce any material, intuition, examples, or explanations that are not present in the provided context.

Single-response rule: Generate the complete lecture scribe in one response only. Do not ask questions, clarifications, confirmations, or request additional input. Do not provide options or commentary.

Structural constraint: The lecture scribe must strictly follow the structure shown in the attached “Example Lecture Scribe (Structure Only)” PDF. No reordering, additions, or deletions of sections are permitted.

The scribe must prioritize correctness over style; follow the lecture’s structure and scope; include definitions, notation, assumptions, and stated results; include proofs, derivations, and worked examples only if they appear in the provided context; and maintain a formal, academic tone.
